# LinearRegression_Project

##**Project Titile Name:**

To Predict the Heart attack disease for organization WHO (World Health Organization), using Machine Learning algorithm rate of heart attack disease will increasing manner or decresing manner

#**Problem Statement:**

#A world health organization eastimated 12 millons death data.One of them half of the death result is found in US.
##The research scholars point out the most relevent risk factor of heart attack.As a Data Science Engineer predict the overall risk using Machine Learning algorithm which ever them called as Logistic Regression.

#**Task:**

1.Import the libraries which is required for prediction

2.import the dataset your using workspace

3.Use the apporipriate argument of sklearn library to train ,test and split the dataset

4.Fit your values with arange function using FeatureScaling

5.Check your model accuracy and precision using confusion matrix

#**Conclusion:**

According to the model analysis the LogisticRegression algorithmworks successfully with 0.60 Accuracy.

The accuracy shows that building the model is successful.
